# Content Management

We have to separate company-related content from personal content.

- References, such as books or public web pages:
	- Use cloud drives(google drive or microsoft onedrive) 
	  because their sizes are large.
	- Need to sync or backup
	- Company related docs should be kept inside the company.
	
- Web bookmarks:
	- Public URLs can be shared, use raindrop.io or the like.
	- company restricted URLs should be in Wiki or OneNote with git or cloud backup.
	
- Notes:
	- Public notes should initiate in OneNote and move to Git.
	- Company restricted should be in OneNote with git or cloud back, or Wiki pages.
	
- Code/Artifacts:
	- Git(public, company restricted, or private)
	
To share
- Zoom with white board
- cloud drives
