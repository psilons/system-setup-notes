# Programming Tools

## Database GUI clients
[DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/) is a free and good tool.  

[Sequel pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) is free on Mac.

[This review](https://codingsight.com/10-best-mysql-gui-tools/)
has other tools (not restricted to MySQL), such as Aqua Data Studio and Navicat.

## Linux Tools
There are several Linux tools:  
- [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is a linux interactive GUI. 
  This is used mainly for remote access. The free version can create at most
  10 sessions. Here is the [setup](mobaxterm/mobaxterm.md).
- [unxutils](https://anaconda.org/binstar/unxutils/files) is a command line 
  package. These can be used in scripts. Wget is included, but curl is not.
  Windows 10 includes curl(run where curl on command). Otherwise, we can get 
  curl from [curl.se](https://curl.se/windows/).
- [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) is more powerful, especially if we need to
  compile C++ code. Another option is [MinGW64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php).
  Or use [MS Visual Studio](vs_cmd.png).
- Windows new terminal package has a linux shell.  
- Oracle [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or 
  [alternatives](https://beebom.com/best-virtualbox-alternatives/).

## Java
- [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
  or [OpenJDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11), [OpenJDK 14](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/14)
  Currently, version 8 is still the main stream(JDK 8 update 202 is the last 
  free version). See these discussions for more info:
  [JRebel Java Report](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/2020-java-technology-report) (Very informative),
  [Which free version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250782/which-free-version-of-java-can-i-use-for-production-environments-and-or-commerci),

  [Java Trend](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/status-quo-and-technology-trend-report-of-java_596778),
  [Java versions and features](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/a-guide-to-java-versions-and-features).
  
  [Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/overview.html)
  supports JKD8u60+ and JDK11.
  
  I would go with OpenJDK11 for now.
