# Content Management

All generated content should be in git!

All references/content should be indexed for search!

Back up to NAS and Cloud periodically.

- Local sandbox for drafts(OneNote) or downloads
- Local Keeper for re-org, tagging, and grouping
- Periodic Cloud/NAS Backup

## Contents
We have to separate company-related content from personal content.

- References, such as books or public web pages:
	- Use cloud drives(google drive or microsoft onedrive) 
	  because their sizes are large.
	- Need to sync or backup
	- Company related docs should be kept inside the company.
	
- Web bookmarks:
	- Public URLs can be shared, use **raindrop.io** or the like.
	- Restricted URLs should be in Wiki or OneNote with git or cloud backup.
	
- Notes:
	- Public notes should initiate in OneNote and move to Git.
	- Restricted notes should be in OneNote with git or cloud back, or Wiki pages.
	
- Code/Artifacts:
	- Git(public, restricted, or private)

## Document Writers

There are several ways to write documents:
- OneNote: for quick and dirty notes. It organizes notes with left groups, top tabs, and right 
  pages.  
  There are cloud based notes, evernote or simple note. But they are not as organized as OneNote.
- MS Word: for general usage, not heavy on Math or Science.
- MarkDown: simple formatted but heavily used in programming world.
- Latex: Grand Master writer, but take some time to learn it. [OverLeaf](http://overleaf.com) is
  a cloud Latex tool with GitHub integration.

MarkDown Converters:
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a tool to convert word to md.

convert excel.
